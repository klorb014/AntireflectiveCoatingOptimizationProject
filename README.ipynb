    "\n",
    "Single layer and multi-layer anti-reflectinve coating can be used to minimize reflection. However, traditional interface analysis becomes very difficult as the number of layers increase. Due to the increasing difficulty to calculate the reflectance and transmittance using only the Fresnel’s equations as the number of layers increases, the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) was devised. This method decomposes the calculation into smaller components. The TMM can handle an arbitrarily sized multilayer system by describing the resulting transfer matrix as the product of the wave interactions at each respective layer as shown:"

The electric field components denoted with a “+” in Figure 1.0 are the forward propagating component of the wave while the field components denoted with a “-” are the backward propagating components. The subscript assigned to each component denotes the medium that it is in. The prime symbol distinguishes the right-hand side of a medium from the left-hand side. While layers 1 to N are slabs of finite width, medium 0 and N+1 are assumed to be unbounded. In order to describe the transmission and reflection of the wave at each interface, a boundary condition is created. Using this detailed description of the multilayer system, the TMM can create a transfer matrix that can equate the unbounded region n0 to the other unbounded region N+1. In order to do so, the Transfer matrix will be built up using the interaction of light at each interface and the interaction of light in each medium. First, in order to describe the interaction of light at each interface, a dynamical matrix will be used as follows:"
