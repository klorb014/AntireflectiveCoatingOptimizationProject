Solar panels offer a renewable source of power which harnesses energy from the sun. The amount of power that can be generated by a modern solar panel is contigent on the amount of light that shines on its surface. Therefore, if the amount of light absorbed by the panel can be maximized, the power generation can be increased. However, when an electromagnetic wave is incident on a medium, there will be a component of the incident wave that is transmitted into the medium and a component that is reflected. This behaviour is governed by Fresnelâ€™s equations:

$$
\begin{matrix} \Gamma_{TE} = \frac{\eta_2 cos \theta_i - \eta_1 cos \theta_t}{\eta_2 cos \theta_i + \eta_1 cos \theta_t} & 
\tau_{TE} = \frac{\eta_2 cos \theta_i}{\eta_2 cos \theta_i + \eta_1 cos \theta_t} \\ 
\Gamma_{TM} = \frac{\eta_2 cos \theta_t - \eta_1 cos \theta_i}{\eta_2 cos \theta_t + \eta_1 cos \theta_i} & 
\tau_{TM} = \frac{\eta_2 cos \theta_i}{\eta_2 cos \theta_t + \eta_1 cos \theta_i} 
\end{matrix}
